## About

This application makes use of javascript/jquery's ajax functionality to request data from gifphy's API. When you click a button with a specific topic, the app will use ajax to search gigphy's library of gifs and display 10 of them on the screen. The gifs initially display as stills and can be clicked to animate. There is also a random button that pulls one random gif with no specific search topic. The user may also add buttons of whatever topic they want to use and find more gifs with. If so desired, the user may clear out the gif box and topic buttons.
